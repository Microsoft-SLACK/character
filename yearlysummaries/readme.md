Yearly summaries
================

**Note:** this data was several months old at the time the article was written; I don't think it is used in the final workflow.

The texts we are working with come from three different sources:

Public-domain HathiTrust texts (mostly before 1923).

In-copyright HathiTrust texts (mostly after 1922).

Novels from the Chicago text lab (mostly American).

The corrected_hathi_summaries aggregate the first two sources; chicago_summary is the last.

Corrected_summaries aggregates all three.

"Corrected," here, means that we used the version of metadata produced *after* correcting 10% of the author genders using manually-produced data.

**authorratios.csv** -- data generated by plot_scripts/pubweekly_gender_plots.py and then generated by plot_scripts/rplots/hathiwithpubweeklybars.R

**auth_specific_charpredict.tsv** is data from the prediction of character gender *within* groups of books written by men, or by women. Like much of the model output here, it exists as two paired files. The **charpredict** file contains all the output for four different L2 hyperparameter settings. The **optimums** file contains only the best L2 setting for each sample; it's the data actually used to generate the viz in the article.

Similarly, **authgender_predictions.tsv** is the full output from the models using a character to predict author gender, and **authgender_prediction_optimums.tsv** are only the runs with the best L2 setting for that sample. The latter were used for visualization.

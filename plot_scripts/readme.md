**gender_plots** is code David wrote to do bootstrap resampling for the blog post. Also included here because we're going to use that in the final article.

**ggplot_scripts** are R scripts used in the blogpost.

**pubweekly_gender_plots.py** is code that generates data used in a viz that superimposes a HathiTrust line on error bars from Publishers Weekly. The data it generates goes into the **/dataforR** folder at the top level of the **/character** repo, and then is visualized by a script in **/rplots.**

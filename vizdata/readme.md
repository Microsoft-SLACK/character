This directory contains data and metadata used in an interactive visualization.

The visualization was designed by Nikolaus Parulian, using data gathered by Ted Underwood -- which in turn depended on work by David Bamman, Boris Capitanu, Bridget Baird, and Cameron Blevins.

The project was supported by the WCSA+DC grant, administered by the HathiTrust Research Center, and funded ultimately by the Andrew G. Mellon Foundation.

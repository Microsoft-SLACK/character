Words Used in Characterization: English-Language Fiction 1800-2007
==================================================================

This directory contains data and metadata used in [an interactive visualization.](http://ec2-35-165-215-214.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/dataviz/genderviz)

The visualization was designed by Nikolaus Parulian, using data gathered by Ted Underwood -- which in turn depended on work by David Bamman, Boris Capitanu, Bridget Baird, and Cameron Blevins.

The file 5k_words_by_yr_and_gender.csv.zip contains the data used in the visualization. It is based on 110,041 volumes; for a list of them consult character/metadata. For each year, this file tabulates occurences of words broken out by the way the word was used (in dialogue or in describing the character's actions and attributes), as well as the gender of the book's author and the gender of the character. For reasons of space and performance, the file contains only the 5,000 most common words in the corpus.

This project was supported by the WCSA+DC grant, administered by the HathiTrust Research Center, and funded ultimately by the Andrew G. Mellon Foundation.

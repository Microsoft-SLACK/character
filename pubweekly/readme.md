publishers weekly
=================

Data gathered from Publisher's Weekly Digital Archive. (There are several resources associated with Publisher's Weekly; getting this one requires a little fishing around; in my library search engine, capitalization and the location of the apostrophe actually mattered!)

In particular, we're sampling titles from the **Weekly Record**, which is relatively early in the issue in the early portion of the print run, and near the back of the magazine later in the print run.

Column meanings:

*date* is the year the notice appeared in PW

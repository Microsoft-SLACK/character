Research on characterization
============================

Repo containing code and data for research on characterization (Ted Underwood and David Bamman, 2015-17).

The original texts of many volumes are under copyright, and couldn't be shared even if the size limits of this repository permitted. So we are sharing derived data, plus metadata which would allow a researcher to retrieve those original texts from HathiTrust Research Center.
